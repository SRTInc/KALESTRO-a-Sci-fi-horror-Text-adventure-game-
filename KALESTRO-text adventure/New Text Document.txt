case 1:












Demo game in which technically the protoagonist dies at the hands of the killer android 91-F

But it sets the stage for the actual protoagonist who shows up 15mins late.
All these events take place in some other planet station...the station is now in ruins and 
dangerous stuff lurks at every corner.

AMV corp is the outerlying antagonists who is responsible for this mess.
